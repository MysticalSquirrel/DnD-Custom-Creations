Drowr - v0.1.2

Race Lore:
Similar to the Drows, the Drowrs established themselves deep under the surface, but where even the Drows would not dare cross. Somewhere even scarier than the nine-hells.
Being one of the first spawns of Lolth's new expansion, the Drowrs are well
established in the material world's first nest created by their queen.

Settled into the nest, the giant network of thick webbing from the guardians crosses to
form a gigantic platform where the Drowr built the only settlement the size of an eperopolis.

After creating this new specie, Lolth made it clear to the Drows that she had new plans
to bring chaos onto the material world by having them secure the nest's entrance while
she created the four guardians of her lair. Four daughters to her image so she could
enter the material world and finally bring permanent chaos.
The daughters are: Loeira the Spellweaver, Ophae the Shadowthreader, Toeyra the Bodybreaker, and Hophaelia the Warden.

Hophaelia being bigger than the other daughters as she was the first daughter,
broke one of her leg leaving a massive shard cutting through an underground chasm leading
to one of the Underdark's nest entrance as she was creating the first nest's layer.
The shard now serves as an anchor to this world for Lolth and is protected by the four guardians as it is the center pillar of the chamber.


Racial Features:

- Lolth's creatures are friendly to you, but to the other races you are as worst as the devil himself.

- Your mind is connected to the nest's network. Thus, you see, know, and can communicate with any other creature connected to the network.

- The Drowrs are only known from above the Underdark as a legend whilst they are known to the Underdark.

- The creatures of the Underdark fear the nest as its guardians are not only gargantuan in size,
but they are also Lolth's new daughters only rivaled in size by
Lolth herself. The only things you can see and use to distinguish them from the dark are
their glowing eyes who give off light in a star-like pattern.

- Your intimidation proficiency bonus is tripled and you are proficient in intimidation.
It is also applied to the charisma saving throw.

- The other creatures you communicate with hear you as if you were in their head.


Limitations:

Being a Drowr has its advantages, but also limits compatibility with other form of ability usage.
You are thus limited to the use of these classes only:
1. Spellweaver - Focuses on using magic given by Lolth and expanding it into a proper skillset rather than simply a life force.

2. Shadowthreader - Has learned to use the fangs for piercing and applying poison, the legs for slashing as well as crushing.

3. Bodybreaker - Has learned from the true daughters that size and strength is not only for show and tell.

4. Warden - The Guardian Disciple has a web of his own covering the entire body.
The web is extremely sticky and is sharper than a razor blade.
(More may be added in the future)
