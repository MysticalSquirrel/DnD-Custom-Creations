# **Spellweaver** Version **0.1.4**

## **Class Lore:**

From their first breath, the Spellweaver has had more control over their magical powers than the other Drowrs.

With that power though came a boon. As powerful as they are, their magic prowess are limited in their nature.
They have no control over any other magic that is found in the material world.

Even if the Drowrs magic causes the same effects such as fire, the magical source of these effects are incompatible.

As they received Lolth's gift, they also received a single goal shared by every other Drowr:
Expand the nest as to allow Lolth to roam the meterial world.

## **Class Features:**

- As a Spellweaver you inherit lolth's power. Although it is limited for the time being, every conquest you accomplish, whether it is settling a new nest or doing actions towards it, will acquire you additional powers as a reward from your queen.

- All of your spells are thrown on a webbing. If you miss your target, be mindful of those behind it as the webbing could land onto them instead and do the spell's effect to them.

- Regular means of healing are halved.

## **Physical Deformation:**
Your eyes are seperated into two beads each that simulates a shape similar to regular eyes.
The amount of beads can be higher as to your liking.
There is very little smoothness to your motion. It is snappy.

### **1st Level:**
- **Web:** You throw a **web that covers any surface** and renders the area into a **difficult terrain**.
**You are not affected by any web due to your nature**. At the **beginning of every turn a creature starts into the web**, they must do a **Dexterity Saving Throw**.

  1. A **web**, regardless of its origin, and **gain 1d3 HP for a small** web, **1d6 HP for a medium** web, **1d10 HP for a large** web and an **extra 1d4 HP per Higher Cast Level**.

You can **fill containers** with this method. **Due to your nature you only take the initial 1d6 only if you are standing directly onto the acid**.
    3. The threads **transform into water**. The **area of effect expands by 10 feet** and **any creature** in the area must **succeed a Dexterity Saving Throw or be knocked prone**. The area is **still considered difficult terrain**. **You are not affected by these effects due to your nature**.
    4. The web **wraps around a chosen target** in an attempt to **immobilize it**. The target must do a **Strength Saving Throw**, on **failure the target takes 1d6 Crushing Damage**.

    If **more than two creatures** get caught, they **also take the extra 1d4 damage** and must do a **Dexterity Saving Throw** to avoid being **caught on one of the other creatures weapons**.
    If they **fail the Dexterity Saving Throw**, they take an **additional 2 Damage with the weapon's damage type**.
    If cast from a **higher lever slot, add an extra 1d4 Crushing Damage**.
    5. The web **lights up** providing light for the **area**. Any creature with **darkvision or better** has to **succeed** on a **Constitution Saving Throw** or take **1d6 Radiant Damage** and be **Blinded until the beginning of their turn**.

    1. **Ophae:** Ophae hides in the shadow of her sisters. Ready to strike at any moment.
        - Whether you are **hidden or not**, your attacks cannot be tracked accurately by the enemies.
            - They must succeed a **Perception Roll at disadvantage** to determine where your attacks come from.
            - If they fail, your **attacks automatically hit** and inflict an **extra 1d4 Poison Damage per Level you possess in the Spellweaver Class**.

            - If the element **should do a lethal effect** such as **petrify** or **instant death**, you must **roll a percentile dice** and roll **over 98, at level 5 it lowers to 95, at level 8 it lowers to 90, at level 15 it lowers to 80 and at level 20 it lowers to 70**.
        - Creatures killed by your **poison solidify into a magically enchanted jade shard** that can be used to **create a new anchor for your nest**'s network.

    2. **Loeira:** This guardian is lolth's magical link to her spawns.
    Transforming into this form gives all your spell an additional effect:
        - Your **Damaging Spells** are now considered **one cast level higher**. They also have a **chance to apply Lolth's Curse**. The target has to **roll a percentile dice and roll over 50 + your Spell DC**.
            - On a **success** the target takes **1d6 Mental Damage** due to fighting against the power of Lolth.
            - On a **failure**, the target is **afflicted by Lolth's Curse** which **needs to be healed with greater restoration**.
            - The **target afflicted by the Curse** has an **advantage** when trying to **convince a powerful enough healer** due to the nature of Lolth's Curse and its **danger for the material world**.
            - **The Curse does not stack**.
            - The Curse **slowly transforms the creature into a crystaline form** to be **used as a new anchor point for lolth**'s nesting network.

    3. **Toeyra:** Toeyra brutaly shows her strength by tearing the bodies of any intruders and using them as housing for the spawns' eggs.
        - Your **attacks** are considered **critical on a roll of 19 or 20**.
        - You emanate an **aura of fear in a 10 feat radius around you**. **Any creature** caught in the aura must **succeed on an Intelligence Saving Throw or be Frightened** preventing the creature from intentionally going towards you.
        - When you **kill a creature**, **spiders starts to rush inside its body** to **create a new potential anchor for your nest**'s network.

    4. **Hophaelia:** Being the biggest and oldest of the four sisters, she is also the toughest.
        - Your **AC is doubled**.
        - You can **use your web as a bonus action** to **Grapple, Knock Prone, or Immobilize a creature**.
            - The creature must **succeed on a Strength or Dexterity Saving Throw** or be **affected by the chosen effect** from the list above.
        - **You** are considered a **Large Creature** and take a **10 feet cube space**. If you have the **Half-Guardian Specialization**, you occupy a **20 feet cube space** and are instead **considered Huge**.
        - Your **movement speed is increased to 60 feets** and you can **climb any surface at the same speed**.
        - You can **jump** up to **twice your movement speed** in distance on a single jump.
        - Due to your **size and the chitin legs you possess**, you are **not affected by any liquid surfaces that are 5 feet deep or less**. **Any liquid surfaces under 10 feet deep**, you take **half damage** and when **over 10 feet deep you take the regular amount of damage**.
        - **As you transform**, **any creature caught in your new space** gets **pushed 10 feets backwards and takes 1 Blunt Damage**.
