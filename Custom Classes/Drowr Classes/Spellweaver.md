# **Spellweaver** Version **1.0**

## **Class Lore:**

From their first breath, the Spellweaver has had more control over their magical powers than the other Drowrs.

With that power though came a boon. As powerful as they are, their magic prowess are limited in their nature.
They have no control over any other magic that is found in the material world.

Even if the Drowrs magic causes the same effects such as fire, the magical source of these effects are incompatible.

As they received Lolth's gift, they also received a single goal shared by every other Drowr:
Expand the nest as to allow Lolth to roam the meterial world.

## **Class Features:**

- As a Spellweaver you inherit lolth's power. Although it is limited for the time being, every conquest you accomplish, whether it is settling a new nest or doing actions towards it, will acquire you additional powers as a reward from your queen.

- All of your spells are thrown on a piece of web. If you miss your target, be mindful of those behind it as the webbing could land onto them instead and do the spell's effect to them.

- Regular means of healing are halved.

- You are not affected by any negative effect that would happen from your own spells due to your nature.

## **Physical Deformation:**
Your eyes are seperated into two beads each that form into a shape similar to regular eyes.
The amount of beads can be higher as to your liking.
There is very little smoothness to your motion. It is snappy.
