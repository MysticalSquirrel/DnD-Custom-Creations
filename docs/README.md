# **One More Quest**'s Custom D&D Creations
Please note that everything you find here is subject to change at a moment's notice.

Even when noted as 100% completed and tested, a lot may change and still be considered balanced in some case or simply not be reflected completely in the completion, testing and balancing status section.

I will try to update the Status as to reflect as better as possible the current state of the project's content, but there will always be some discrepancy.

## **Project completion, testing and balancing Status**:
**Up to level:**
- ***Drowr:*** **4**

**Specializations:**
- ***Drowr:*** **80%**
    - **Eyes of Lolth**: **80%** - Needs Testing
    - **Lolth Marked**: **80%** - Needs Testing
    - **Half-Guardian**: **80%** - Needs Testing
    - **Shadow of Lolth**: **80%** - Needs Testing
    - **Lolth Infused**: **80%** - Needs Testing

**Classes:**

    - **Spellweaver**: **80%** - Add More Spells and Needs Testing
    - **Shadowthreader**: **0%** - Not Started
    - **Fleshcarver**: **0%** - Not Started
    - **Warden**: **0%** - Not Started

**Systems:**
