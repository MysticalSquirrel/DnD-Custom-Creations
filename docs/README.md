# **One More Quest**'s Custom D&D Creations
Please note that everything you find here is subject to change at a moment's notice.

Even when noted as 100% completed and tested, a lot may change and still be considered balanced in some case or simply not be reflected completely in the completion, testing and balancing status section.

I will try to update the Status as to reflect as better as possible the current state of the project's content, but there will always be some discrepancy.

## **Project completion, testing and balancing Status:**

**Up to level:**
- **Ash'phn:** **4**

**Races:**
- **Ash'phn:** **80%**

**Classes:**
- **Spellweaver**: **80%** - Add More Spells and Needs Testing
- **Shadowthreader**: **0%** - Not Started
- **Fleshcarver**: **0%** - Not Started
- **Warden**: **0%** - Not Started

**Systems:**
- **One More Quest:** **1%** - Still is super early in the creation process.


## **Latest Fixes:**
- Changing the Drowr race into a new race that would better fit the Planes of Existance's Great Wheel.
