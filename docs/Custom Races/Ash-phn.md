# **Ash'phn** - Version **0.1**

## **Race Lore:**

As time wove into existance, planes were burst into actuals in the violence of transfers between the balancing forces of time. In one of the most vicious transfer between the upper Mount Celestia plane and the lower Abyssal plane, fragments were stripped from both and were caught into other planes allowing a new life to burst into existance and settle between two of the primal planes in an unknowingly stable area between Shadowfell, the Fire plane and the Earth. Somewhere strangely disconnected from the Ethereal plane.

With influence from the Elemental Chaos, the newly created specie would form into some sort of an ashy fungus with the ability of having its own consciousness.

As the small area between planes started settling down into a more stable form, the fungal entity started spreading and multiplying until the stability would no longer support its weight.

Over that period of time, an area already had been graced by the four elements in a mean to give the most stable plane. The Material plane. On that plane, different species were already starting to form and in some cases would even start wars between each others. Wearing each others out until in some crowned realm, erupted a burst of energy from the breaking of a bond.

Multiple portals were seen appearing on the surface as well as in the undergrounds of the plane seeding fear into the nearby settlements.

On that day, the Ash'phn's unstable area no longer able to stabilize itself enough nor fight against the Elemental Chaos, simply sent all of its content through the multiple time fissures that appeared within it. Allowing the Ash'phn to roam the Material Plane as their own specie.

In the process of moving to the Material Plane, they changed into various forms that would support their strange nature into this plane kept safely away from the Elemental Chaos by the elements themselves.
