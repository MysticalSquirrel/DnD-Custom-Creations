# **NO LONGER USED FOR THIS PROJECT! THIS MIGHT CHANGE IN THE FUTURE. BUT THERE IS NO CURRENT PLAN TO UPDATE THIS PAGE!**

Idea:

Make wizard create elemental essences that they can combine to create spells.

They can create essences of different tiers depending on their level and epic level.

Lvl 1-5 Lesser.
Lvl 6-13 Major.
Lvl 14-17 Lesser Augmented
Lvl 18-19 Major Augmented
Lvl 20 Divine

5% of the gained experience goes into the Epic levels.

Lvl 1-4 Epic: random chance to create a better version.
Lvl 5 Epic: Can choose between: Primal, Ancient, Celestial, Abyssal. Is assured to be a better version.
