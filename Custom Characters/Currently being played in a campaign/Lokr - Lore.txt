As any other Ash-phn, Lokr came from a strange distortion in the unstable elemental chaos present between the Fire, Earth, and Shadowfell planes.
Alongside each others, the Ash-phn morphed with the different species of the material plane. As for this fungal fragment, it fused with some strangely infused human-like creature.
In the process the creature's infusion was lost as Lolth completely lost control over it when the fungal powers spread through the creature's body.

As the creature fought to keep its grip on its own body, it slowly began losing control over its own soul and was consumed by the fungus thus creating a new entity from Lokr's being.
The new Lork, using its newly obtained body started wandering about in search of some adventurer group that he had seen in the mind of the previous Lokr before its destruction.

Now Lokr is in search of a way to ensure a future for his home world.
